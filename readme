Probabilistic random generator
ProbabilisticRandomGenFactory has a static method create that take a List<NumAndProbability> and
returns a ProbabilisticRandomGen instance
I used factory method because it is flexible and ProbabilisticRandomGenImpl can be modified with a
different implementation in future without affect the caller who is calling the factory method

EventBus
MultiThreadedEventBus extends EventBus interface and adds a couple of extra methods to the
interface which is implemented by MultiThreadedEventBusImpl. Supports multiple threads
SingleThreadedEventBusImpl implements EventBus for single threads

ThrottlerImpl implement Throttler interface. Uses a timer object to schedule the execution
